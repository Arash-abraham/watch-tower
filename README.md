# Real-Time Monitoring Without Blind Spots

Watch Tower is a modern monitoring system designed to detect newly added assets from defined targets and notify you instantly across multiple channels.

Version 2 is a complete architectural rebuild of:

Bat-Tower (Version 1 – Python/Flask CLI)  
https://github.com/Arash-abraham/Bat-Tower  

---

# Product Evolution

## Before Version 1 – The Early Prototype 🛠️

The origin of Watch Tower was humble: a small, local script that I wrote to **monitor HackerOne program updates**.  

It had only one goal: the moment a new asset appeared, I wanted to **know immediately**. There was no dashboard, no notifications beyond the console — just a simple script printing results in real time.

</p>

This early version taught me **the power of instant awareness**. Despite being tiny and local, it proved that monitoring could be reactive — not just passive. Every line of code here planted the seed for the fully-fledged Watch Tower platform that would follow. 🚀  

---

## Version 1 – Bat-Tower

- Python + Flask 🐍  
- CLI-only interface  
- Trigger-based detection  
- Discord-only notifications 🔔  
- No dashboard  
- No multi-user support  

Functional, but limited in scope. Bat-Tower was the bridge from experiment to product.

---

## Version 2 – Watch Tower

Rebuilt entirely using:

- Laravel 12  
- Livewire 3  
- Volt class-based components  
- Tailwind CSS  
- Architected for Laravel Echo (WebSocket broadcasting)  

This version introduces:

- Reactive web dashboard 💻  
- Multi-channel notifications (Discord, Telegram, In-App)  
- Authentication system 🔑  
- Scalable architecture 🌐  
- SaaS-ready foundation  

---

# Core Capabilities

## Real-Time Reactive Dashboard

Assets appear instantly without refresh.  
Powered by Livewire 3 reactivity, structured for Laravel Echo integration.  
Designed for speed and clarity. ⚡  

---

## Multi-Channel Notification Engine

When a new asset is detected:

You choose how you’re notified:

- Discord  
- Telegram  
- In-dashboard alerts  
- SMS (planned 📱)  

Unlike v1 which supported only Discord, v2 introduces **redundancy and flexibility**.

---

## Laravel Echo Ready

- WebSocket-powered live broadcasting  
- Real-time UI synchronization  
- Multi-user concurrent updates  
- Future collaborative monitoring features  

---
