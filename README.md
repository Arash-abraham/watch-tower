# Watch Tower ⚡

A clean, modern web application built with **Laravel**, **Livewire 3** + **Volt**  
Currently under active development → version 2 coming soon!

> "Keeping an eye on what matters – simple, fast, reactive."

## ✨ Features (so far)

- Class-based Volt components (the new functional + elegant way)
- Full Livewire 3 reactivity – no more page reloads
- Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI / Flowbite / whatever nice UI kit you're using
- Clean folder structure with Volt's single-file components
- Authentication (Breeze / Jetstream / custom)
- Responsive design that actually feels good on mobile
- Dark mode support (because who codes in light mode anymore?)
- Ready for real-time features (Laravel Reverb / Echo coming soon?)

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **PHP** → Laravel 12.x
- **Frontend** → Livewire 3 + Volt (class-based components)
- **Styling** → Tailwind CSS v3 + (your favorite component library)
- **Database** → MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (your choice)
- **Icons** → Heroicons / Lucide / Phosphor (whatever you love)
- **Deployment-ready** → Docker support coming in v2

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Arash-abraham/watch-tower.git
