# Real-Time Monitoring Without Blind Spots

Watch Tower is a modern monitoring system designed to detect newly added assets from defined targets and notify you instantly across multiple channels.

Version 2 is a complete architectural rebuild of:

Bat-Tower (Version 1 – Python/Flask CLI)  
https://github.com/Arash-abraham/Bat-Tower  

---

# Product Evolution

## Before Version 1 (Early Prototype)

Originally, the system was a very small local script.

It simply monitored HackerOne program updates and immediately printed when a new asset was added.

</p>

This was the seed.

---

## Version 1 – Bat-Tower

- Python + Flask
- CLI-only interface
- Trigger-based detection
- Discord-only notifications
- No dashboard
- No multi-user support

Functional, but limited in scope.

---

## Version 2 – Watch Tower

Rebuilt entirely using:

- Laravel 12
- Livewire 3
- Volt class-based components
- Tailwind CSS
- Architected for Laravel Echo (WebSocket broadcasting)

This version introduces:

- Reactive web dashboard
- Multi-channel notifications
- Authentication system
- Scalable architecture
- SaaS-ready foundation

---

# Core Capabilities

## Real-Time Reactive Dashboard

Assets appear instantly without refresh.

Powered by Livewire 3 reactivity, structured for Laravel Echo integration.

Designed for speed and clarity.

---

## Multi-Channel Notification Engine

When a new asset is detected:

You choose how you’re notified:

- Discord
- Telegram
- In-dashboard alerts
- SMS (planned, high probability)

Unlike v1 which supported only Discord, v2 introduces redundancy and flexibility.

---

## Laravel Echo Ready

The architecture is prepared for:

- WebSocket-powered live broadcasting
- Real-time UI synchronization
- Multi-user concurrent updates
- Future collaborative monitoring features

---
