# Watch Tower ⚡

Modern, reactive web app powered by **Laravel 11** + **Livewire 3** + **Volt**  
✨ Currently cooking v2 – expect something even cleaner and faster!

> "Watch what matters. React instantly. Stay elegant."

## ✨ What's Cooking Right Now

- Volt class-based components (the cool new Laravel way)
- Zero-reload magic with Livewire 3
- Tailwind CSS + beautiful component library vibes
- Single-file Volt components – clean & organized
- Breeze / custom auth with nice flows
- Mobile-first responsive design that actually feels premium
- Dark mode baked in (light mode is for screenshots only)
- Preparing for real-time superpowers (Reverb + Echo on the horizon)

## 🛠 Tech That Feels Good

- **Backend** → Laravel 11.x  
- **Frontend Magic** → Livewire 3 + Volt  
- **Styling** → Tailwind CSS v3 + (DaisyUI / Flowbite / your flavor)  
- **Database** → MySQL • PostgreSQL • SQLite  
- **Icons** → Heroicons / Lucide / whatever sparks joy  
- **Future-proof** → Docker + deployment goodies in v2

## 🚀 Get It Running in 60 Seconds
